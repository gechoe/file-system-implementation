-- Extra Note -------------------------------------------------------------------
* If you would like to see the layout of our fake disks (fake_disk_1 and fake_disk_2)
  please visit the program files (fake_disk_1.c and fake_disk_2.c) or look at
  disk_layout.txt for more context~!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Files:
==============
    Part 1 - Frontend:
        shell.c

    Part 2 - Backend:
        For formatting the disk:
        format.c

        For the filesystem:
            filesystem.h
            filesystem.c
            fake_disk_1.c
            fake_disk_2.c
            /disks - Folder containing all the compiled fake disks
                    (fake_disk_1.img & fake_disk_2.img) which gets updated when
                    make fake_disks is called.
   
   Part 0 - Fake Test Disks:
        fake_disk_1.c
        fake_disk_2.c

*****
How to Compile:
===============
    For compiling all files (you can use make OR make all):
        make
    Part 1 - Frontend (you can use make frontend OR make shell):
        make frontend -> Compiles everything in frontend
        make shell

    Part 2 - Backend (you can use make backend OR compile each part individually):
    * IMPORTANT NOTE -> Fake disks must be compiled/make'd before filesystem
        make backend -> Compiles everything in backend
            OR (do the below in the order listed)
        make format
        make fake_disks -> Compiles all fake disks
        make fake_disk_1 -> Compiles fake_disk_1.c
        make fake_disk_2 -> Compiles fake_disk_2.c
        make filesystem
   
   Part 0 - Fake Test Disks:
        make fake_disks -> Compiles all fake disks
            OR
        make fake_disk_1 -> Compiles fake_disk_1.c
        make fake_disk_2 -> Compiles fake_disk_2.c

*****
How to Run:
===========
    Part 1 - Frontend:
        ./shell

    Part 2 - Backend (do the below in the order listed):
        make run_disks
        ./filesystem
            OR
        ./fake_disk_1
        ./fake_disk_2
        ./filesystem

        format.c:
            To run:
                ./format <filename> -> ex: ./format DISK
            To run with specified size:
                ./format <filename> -s <num MB requested>  -> ex: ./format DISK -s 2

*****
Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    The filesystem is not fully implemented. The front and backend are not
    integrated, thus, we will be showing how each part implemented so far can
    work and run by itself. Look at the section below for more information on
    the parts implemented.

    Assumptions: 
        - all given path will be absolute path. 
        - all files can be accessed by any user. (everyone is superuser.)
